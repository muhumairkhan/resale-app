## Community Problem

I live in a community where we have a water filteration plant. There is a small notice board that is used by the staff 
to update notify when was the filters changed on this plant. But unfortunately the people of my community have
started using that notice board as an adverstisemnet board for selling their used products. This has created a lot of issues:

General Problems:
- The notice board is for the date when the filter was changed last time not for advertisement.
- The notice board area is too small, not every ad gets placed.
- People have started putting their ad papers the walls next to notice board due to less space on notice board, resulting in damage of the paint on the wall.

Problems for buyers:
- The ads aren't taken down even if the items are sold.
- The ads aren't sorted. 
- It's difficult to find the item the buyer wants.

Problems for sellers:
- Have to create a paper ad and physically go to water filteration plant to place that ad.
- Cannot update the items of the ad.
- Have to pysically go to the water filteration plant to remove the ad once the item is sold.
- Less available space for putting the ad.
- Ad gets hidden under some other ads pasted by other people.
